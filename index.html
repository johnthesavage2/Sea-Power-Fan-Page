                <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <!-- Expand FAQ, add links, dont need breaks -->
                <span class="question">Q: Do I have to know much about naval combat to be able to play the game?</span>
                <p>A: No, but if you know very little, your learning curve will probably look something like <a href="./assets/images/cliffs of dover2.jpg" 
                    target="_blank">this.</a> Some information is more practical, and that should be the emphasis. You don't for example need to know the difference between 
                    X- and P-band radars, but knowing when you should and shouldn't use your radars is important.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How long does a mission usually take?</span>
                <p>A: It depends on the mission and how much time dilation you use. More complicated missions with many ships and different objectives will take longer than a skirmish 
                    between a few ships, or a submarine duel if you use heavy time dilation. But I would say most missions take 1-1.5 hours even with some time compression. 
                    Fortunately saving and loading were added to the game, which makes it possible to stop and come back later, which is a life saver, especially for longer missions.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How well does the game run?</span>
                <p>A: The developers have been doing a good job optimizing the game in order to increase performance. That being said, during development they suggested having a 
                    computer with a dedicated graphics card. The game also calculates lots of variables in a short time, so having a decent CPU is also helpful. With a Ryzen 5 
                    7600 CPU and a 3060 ti graphics card I get about 70 FPS with a small amount of units onscreen, dropping down the more units are created. With a large amount 
                    of units in-game, the frame rate rests around 50 FPS.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How much does the game cost?</span>
                <p>A: The game is $50 on Steam. It occasionally goes on sale, including during the Steam seasonal sales. You can check the price 
                    history <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1286220/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                <span class="question">Q: Is there multiplayer in the game?</span>
                <p>A: Currently there is no multiplayer. The developers have mentioned that they will consider adding it when the singleplayer elements are considered finished. 
                    There is little information as to whether multiplayer would be PvP or Co-op.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What is the modding scene like? Are there any necessary mods?</span>
                <p>A: The game is easily moddable and modders have been working since day 1 on different mods. A lot of them are just user-made scenarios that are mostly pretty 
                    good, some of them weren't the best but overall most of them are definitely worth your time. A lot of mods are also kitbashes of in-game units and custom models of 
                    units that aren't in the game. Personally I prefer more realistic mods in the game's time frame so haven't really dug into most of those mods. There 
                    aren't any necessary mods in my opinion, but some that are popular are nuclearstonk's NTU and Pact Enhanced Lethality mods, some mods that change aircraft 
                    carrier cycle times, and some mission packs like Ian's Pacific Strike '85.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: Are there any tutorials or walkthroughs that I can use to help me gain a better grasp of the game's concepts?</span>
                <p>A: Yes! As of September 2025 the developers added a few tutorials in the game itself that goes over basic concets of how the game works and what you can do to make 
                    it easier to settle into the game, even if you don't know much about naval combat or are unfamiliar with naval strategy games.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: Are there any plans for DLC or expansions?</span>
                <p>There is a possibility that the Royal Navy will be a DLC in the future, although there hasn't been too many details about that. It is unclear whether or not that will 
                    be a paid DLC or free.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What navies are in the game?</span>
                <p>The main navies are the US and Soviet navies, with ships from the East and West German, Japanese, Norweigan, Iranian, Libyan, and other navies. Many navies are 
                    also represented in name, operating ships built by another country, like Poland and Egypt operating Soviet ships, India operating old British ships, and so on. 
                    There are also many neutral and civilian ships and aircraft in the game from various countries, which can be used to make missions more interesting  by forcing 
                    you to identify units before engaging them or risk suffering the consequences of attacking a neutral ship.</p>

            <section class="tips-and-tricks">
                <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <p>I have played the game for about 400 hours in total and also I am very interested in naval combat, both in WW1 and WW2
                    and the cold war. If you're struggling with the game, some of these tips and tricks can help you get a better grip on 
                    the game and have a more satisfying and enjoyable experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be <strong>very</strong> careful with your emissions, both radar and sonar. You can be detected by the enemy a lot 
                        easier if you carelessly run your radars and sonars. With radar, if you have any aircraft, use those as radar stations 
                        before using your warships. Even helicopters are a huge help. If you have to use radar on warships, use them 
                        intermittently and not for long.</li>
                    <li>If using aircraft as radar stations, like AEW or AWACS planes, make sure they have a fighter escort. While less 
                        valuable than a ship, they are still important assets and will be priority targets for hostile aircraft.</li>
                    <li>Be careful with sonar as well. The slower your ships are going, the more effective their sonar will be. Use so-called 
                        sprint-and-drift tactics, where you speed in a certain direction for a few minutes before stopping and using active sonar. 
                        Helicopters are incredibly useful for ASW (Anti-submarine warfare), especially if they have dipping sonars.</li>
                    <li>Sonobouys are borderline necessary for ASW. Using sonobouys turns ASW from defensive to offensive in a heartbeat. Space them 
                        out, at least two nautical miles and no more than five away from each other, and deploy them both above and below the 
                        thermal layer.</li>
                    <li>If you're under attack by air or missile threats, turn on all your radars. The enemy already knows where you are, so being 
                        detected is no longer an issue, and you'll need to see any threats coming for you. That said, once you're confident its over, 
                        go back to EMCON (emissions control, aka turn off all your radars). Same thing with sonars and underwater threats like torpedoes.</li>
                    <li>If you're escorting valuable units like carriers, landing ships, attack aircraft, and the like, <strong>always</strong> keep your 
                        escorting units between the high value units and any hostile units, or at least where they're likely to come from. Defending high-value 
                        units is a lot easier if hostile units have to get through your escorts compared to your escorts having to chase hostile units who 
                        have a clear shot to the high-value units.</li>
                    <li>When launching a missile attack, the goal is to overwhelm and oversaturate the enemy's defenses. Knowing the capabilities of a warship's 
                        anti-air defenses helps in sizing up how many missiles you will need to oversaturate their defenses. Launching every anti-ship missile 
                        from a Soviet ship might seem unnecessary if they have 16-20 for example, but every missile makes the job of missile defense just a 
                        little harder. In the same vein, don't hesitate to launch all your aircraft with anti-ship missiles from an aircraft carrier or airfield 
                        at once.</li>
                    <li>Electronic warfare (EW) is stupidly powerful in both offensive and defensive roles. Missile attacks are much easier if an EW plane is 
                        there jamming hostile radars, which cuts down on the number of missiles you need. Also if your formations are under attack and you have 
                        a carrier present like most US carriers or the Soviet Orel, launching an EW aircraft and using to jam incoming missiles makes it less 
                        likely your ships will be hit. The US has the EA-6B and the Soviets have the Ko-45 EW and T-16P for EW, use them as much as you're able.
                    </li>
                    <li>Knowing the capabilities of weapon systems is key. It's so much easier to make decisions on what to do if you know the capabilities of 
                        both your and hostile weapons. For example knowing the harpoon anti-ship missile's range will tell you how far you need to deploy fighters 
                        to stop aircraft from launching harpoons at your ships, or knowing the range for the SS-N-19 and which Soviet ships carry them will tell 
                        you how far away you need to be in order to keep those ships from launching against you.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing the behavior of unknown ships can give away their identity even if you haven't been able to classify them fully yet. For example 
                        knowing that merchant and other neutral ships or aircraft don't travel in ordered formations will immediately give away the existence of hostile 
                        units if you see several unknown ships traveling at the same speed and course in an ordered formation. Also knowing that most civilian 
                        ships don't travel very quickly, rarely moving more than 20 knots, makes identifying an unknown ship traveling at 30+ knots as hostile easy.
                    </li>
                    <li>For unknown units, the game has the ability to request that they identify themselves. Turn on the radars of any friendly unit, then, with the 
                        friendly unit selected, press Ctrl, right click on the unidentified unit, and then scroll down to "Request: identify yourself." There are three 
                        possible responses: 1. they either acknowledge and you gain their information, 2. they refuse, or 3. they don't respond. In cases 2 and 3 you 
                        gain nothing, but if the unit is hostile they will almost always not respond. So if they refuse they are almost certainly neutral, although it 
                        might still be good to check.</li>
<!-- Having a picture of using the drawing tools would be useful -->
                    <li>On the bottom of the tactical map, there are drawing tools that make it so much easier to draw out distances between objects. The radial 
                        tool is particularly helpful. Use that to overlay weapon ranges to give yourself a visual guide of how close or far your units need to be 
                        to either engage with a weapon system or to ensure that hostile units can't engage your units with weapon systems they have.</li>
