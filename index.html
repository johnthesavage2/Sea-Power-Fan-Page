                <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <!-- Expand FAQ, add links, dont need breaks -->
                <span class="question">Q: Do I have to know much about naval combat to be able to play the game?</span>
                <p>A: No, but if you know very little, your learning curve will probably look something like <a href="./assets/images/cliffs of dover2.jpg" 
                    target="_blank">this.</a> Some information is more practical, and that should be the emphasis. You don't for example need to know the difference between 
                    X- and P-band radars, but knowing when you should and shouldn't use your radars is important.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How long does a mission usually take?</span>
                <p>A: It depends on the mission and how much time dilation you use. More complicated missions with many ships and different objectives will take longer than a skirmish 
                    between a few ships, or a submarine duel if you use heavy time dilation. But I would say most missions take 1-1.5 hours even with some time compression. 
                    Fortunately saving and loading were added to the game, which makes it possible to stop and come back later, which is a life saver, especially for longer missions.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How well does the game run?</span>
                <p>A: The developers have been doing a good job optimizing the game in order to increase performance. That being said, during development they suggested having a 
                    computer with a dedicated graphics card, which I feel is appropriate. The game also calculates lots of variables in a short time, so having a decent CPU is also helpful. 
                    With a Ryzen 5 7600 CPU and a 3060 ti graphics card I get about 70 FPS starting the mission, dropping down the longer the game runs. It usually gets down to 15-25 FPS after about 
                    an hour of playing the same mission, regardless of how many units are in the game.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: How much does the game cost?</span>
                <p>A: The game is $50 on Steam. It occasionally goes on sale, including during the Steam seasonal sales. You can check the price 
                    history <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1286220/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                <span class="question">Q: Is there multiplayer in the game?</span>
                <p>A: Currently there is no multiplayer. The developers have mentioned that they will consider adding it when the singleplayer elements are considered finished. 
                    There is little information as to whether multiplayer would be PvP or Co-op.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What is the modding scene like? Are there any necessary mods?</span>
                <p>A: The game is easily moddable and modders have been working since day 1 on different mods. A lot of them are just user-made scenarios that are mostly pretty 
                    good, some of them weren't the best but overall most of them are definitely worth your time. A lot of mods are also kitbashes of in-game units and custom models of 
                    units that aren't in the game. Personally I prefer more realistic mods in the game's time frame so haven't really dug into most of those mods. There 
                    aren't any necessary mods in my opinion, but some that are popular are nuclearstonk's NTU and Pact Enhanced Lethality mods, some mods that change aircraft 
                    carrier cycle times, and some mission packs like Ian's Pacific Strike '85.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: Are there any tutorials or walkthroughs that I can use to help me gain a better grasp of the game's concepts?</span>
                <p>A: Yes! As of September 2025 the developers added a few tutorials in the game itself that goes over basic concets of how the game works and what you can do to make 
                    it easier to settle into the game, even if you don't know much about naval combat or are unfamiliar with naval strategy games.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: Are there any plans for DLC or expansions?</span>
                <p>The developers mentioned in an AMA on the games first anniversary that they're considering a DLC for 1990's era weapons. They did not go into detail 
                    what exactly that would look like or what ships or aircraft would be a part of that. From their comments in the same AMA it seems that the Royal Navy will be a free 
                    addition to the game, and that other European navies, such as the French, West German, and Italian navies are also being considered for addition, again likely free 
                    updates to the game and not part of DLC, but that is unconfirmed.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What navies are in the game?</span>
                <p>The main navies are the US and Soviet navies, with ships from the East and West German, Japanese, Norweigan, Iranian, Libyan, Chinese, Japanese, and other navies. 
                    Many navies are also represented in name, operating ships built by another country, like Poland and Egypt operating Soviet ships, India operating old British ships, 
                    and so on. There are also many neutral and civilian ships and aircraft in the game from various countries, which can be used to make missions more interesting by forcing 
                    you to identify units before engaging them or risk suffering the consequences of attacking a neutral ship.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What is the state of the game?</span>
                <p>The game is still in Early Access after about a year after release. There has been a lot of additions to the game, both in new units and navies but also new 
                    quality of life and UI updates, as well as performance optimizations. The developers have stated that they are focused on improving the AI in the game and 
                    believe it will be a while before the dynamic campaign is added. As I mentioned in the performance question, there is still a lot of ground to cover in terms
                    of optimization, but the game is very playable in its current state and a lot of fun. There has also been progress made in reducing micromanagement, although
                    aircraft still require a lot of attention, and it gets to be a lot dealing with air assets along with maintaining situational awareness of the rest of your forces.</p>
                <span class="question">Q: What is the dynamic campaign supposed to be?</span>
                <p>The dynamic campaign is still a WIP and so the final details are unknown but the general idea from what the developers have stated is that there will be a strategic map 
                    where you move forces around, and you or the enemy AI can initiate actions, bringing you into the mission mode where you fight with the relevant units in a certain area. 
                    It seems likely, but is not confirmed, that you will be able to create your own formations that you can use to initiate actions on your own. The campaign is currently planned 
                    to be based in the Atlantic Ocean between the US and USSR in the mid-1980s, with other campaigns in other areas and/or time periods possible but not planned.</p>

                    developers did that goes into some detail as to the current state of the game and some of the plans they have for the game's future.</p>

                <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <p>I have played the game for about 400 hours in total and also I am very interested in naval combat, both in WW1 and WW2 and the cold war. If you're struggling with the 
                    game, some of these tips and tricks can help you get a better grip on the game and have a more satisfying and enjoyable experience.</p>
                <div id="tips">
                    <ul id="tips-and-tricks">
                        <li>Be <strong>very</strong> careful with your emissions, both radar and sonar. You can be detected by the enemy a lot easier if you carelessly run your radars and 
                            sonars. With radar, if you have any aircraft, use those as radar stations before using your warships. Even helicopters are a huge help. If you have to use radar 
                            on warships, use them intermittently and not for long.</li>
                        <li>If using aircraft as radar stations, like AEW or AWACS planes, make sure they have a fighter escort. While less valuable than a ship, they are still important 
                            assets and will be priority targets for hostile aircraft.</li>
                        <li>Be careful with sonar as well. The slower your ships are going, the more effective their sonar will be. Use so-called sprint-and-drift tactics, where you speed 
                            in a certain direction for a few minutes before stopping and using active sonar. Helicopters are incredibly useful for ASW (Anti-submarine warfare), especially 
                            if they have dipping sonars.</li>
                        <li>Sonobouys are borderline necessary for ASW. Using sonobouys turns ASW from defensive to offensive in a heartbeat. Space them out, at least two nautical miles 
                            and no more than five away from each other, and deploy them both above and below the thermal layer.</li>
                        <li>If you're under attack by air or missile threats, turn on all your radars. The enemy already knows where you are, so being detected is no longer relevant, 
                            and you'll need to see any threats coming for you. That said, once you're confident its over, go back to EMCON (emissions control, aka turn off all your 
                            radars). Same thing with sonars and underwater threats like torpedoes.</li>
                        <li>If you're escorting valuable units like carriers, landing ships, attack aircraft, and the like, <strong>always</strong> keep your escorting units between the 
                            high value units and any hostile units, or at least where they're likely to come from. Defending high-value units is a lot easier if hostile units have to get 
                            through your escorts compared to your escorts having to chase hostile units who have a clear shot to the high-value units.</li>
                        <li>When launching a missile attack, the goal is to overwhelm and oversaturate the enemy's defenses. Knowing the capabilities of a warship's anti-air defenses helps 
                            in sizing up how many missiles you will need to oversaturate their defenses. Launching every anti-ship missile from a Soviet ship might seem unnecessary if they 
                            have 16-20 for example, but every missile makes the job of missile defense just a little harder. In the same vein, don't hesitate to launch all your aircraft 
                            with anti-ship missiles from an aircraft carrier or airfield at once.</li>
                        <li>Electronic warfare (EW) is stupidly powerful in both offensive and defensive roles. Missile attacks are much easier if an EW plane is there jamming hostile 
                            radars, which cuts down on the number of missiles you need. Also if your formations are under attack and you have a carrier present like most US carriers or 
                            the Soviet Orel, launching an EW aircraft and using to jam incoming missiles makes it less likely your ships will be hit. The US has the EA-6B and the Soviets 
                            have the Ko-45 EW and T-16P for EW, use them as much as you're able.</li>
                        <li>Knowing the capabilities of weapon systems is key. It's so much easier to make decisions on what to do if you know the capabilities of both your and hostile 
                            weapons. For example knowing the harpoon anti-ship missile's range will tell you how far you need to deploy fighters to stop aircraft from launching harpoons 
                            at your ships, or knowing the range for the SS-N-19 and which Soviet ships carry them will tell you how far away you need to be in order to keep those ships 
                            from launching against you.</li>
                        <li>Analyzing the behavior of unknown ships can give away their identity even if you haven't been able to classify them fully yet. For example knowing that merchant 
                            and other neutral ships or aircraft don't travel in ordered formations will immediately give away the existence of hostile units if you see several unknown ships 
                            traveling at the same speed and course in an ordered formation. Also knowing that most civilian ships don't travel very quickly, rarely moving more than 20 knots, 
                            makes identifying an unknown ship traveling at 30+ knots as hostile easy.</li>
                        <li>For unknown units, the game has the ability to request that they identify themselves. Turn on the radars of any friendly unit, then, with the friendly unit selected, 
                            press Ctrl, right click on the unidentified unit, and then scroll down to "Request: identify yourself." There are three possible responses: 1. they either acknowledge 
                            and you gain their information, 2. they refuse, or 3. they don't respond. In cases 2 and 3 you gain nothing, but if the unit is hostile they will almost always not 
                            respond. So if they refuse they are almost certainly neutral, although it might still be good to check.</li>
<!-- Having a picture of using the drawing tools would be useful -->
                        <li>On the bottom of the tactical map, there are drawing tools that make it so much easier to draw out distances between objects. The radial tool is particularly helpful. 
                            Use that to overlay weapon ranges to give yourself a visual guide of how close or far your units need to be to either engage with a weapon system or to ensure that 
                            hostile units can't engage your units with weapon systems they have.</li>
                        <li>Spread out your formations. It is tempting to keep all your ships close together, and while they do provide a high degree of mutual protection
                            when close, they also make it easier for an enemy to detect and attack any high-value units. Spreading your units out will allow them to detect 
                            and engage hostiles before they get a chance at any valuable units. Especially with missile attacks, having a spread out formation that is also 
                            mutually supporting will present a gauntlet that provide more time to engage the missiles, instead of a quick screen that a small formation provides.</li>

                    <li>ASW - Anti-Submarine Warfare: The use of ships, aircraft, and submarines to hunt submarines, using torpedoes, depth charges, 
                        missiles, and sonobuoys.</li>
                    <li>CIWS - Close-In Weapons System: A weapons system that is designed to engage targets close to the ship it is mounted on. 
                        Considered the last line of defense against missiles, aircraft, and small craft. Early systems were 20 or 30 mm gatling guns, 
                        while modern systems include small missiles or lasers.</li>
                    <li>EW - Electronic Warfare: The use of electronic systems such as decoys or radar jamming to degrade an enemy's combat 
                        capability or to increase your own chances for success.</li>
                    <li>EMCON - Emissions Control: Aka "radio silence," preventing the use of radar or radio in order to prevent an enemy from 
                        discovering the existence of friendly forces through intercepting or detecting radio and radar use.</li>
                    <li>NATO - North Atlantic Treaty Organization: A military alliance between the USA, Canada, and several Western and Central European

                    <li>NBC - Nuclear-Biological-Chemical: A way of designing and protecting a ship and it's crew to make it more resistant to nuclear,
                        biological, or chemical attack.</li>
                    <li>PLAN - People's Liberation Army Navy: The official name of the navy of communist China.</li>

                    <li>VLS - Vertical Launch System: A method of launching a missile vertically instead of using a rail launcher. A VLS usually allows 
                        for more missiles to be carried, has a much faster reaction time than a rail launcher, and allows all the ship's missiles to be 
                        available immediately.</li>
                    <li>Warsaw Pact: A defensive alliance between the Soviet Union and several Eastern European communist countries. Analogous to NATO,

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a gamer who spends more time playing naval combat games than doing more productive things like learning coding.
                I followed the development of the game early on after it's public announcement and bought the game on release. I have
                spent many hours playing missions in the game and have created several of my own, although they haven't been shared
                with the wider community.</p>
            <p>I am in no way affiliated with Triassic Games or Microprose, just a fan of the game that wants to share my passion
                for Sea Power. I do not claim ownership of anything belonging to Triassic Games or Microprose.</p>
