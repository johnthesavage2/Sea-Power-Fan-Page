        <p>*Again the Soviets classified ships of the same design by project number and not class name.</p>
        <p>**Many of these ships were classified as corvetts, frigates, missile boats, fast attack craft, etc. For simplicity's sake, I am classifying them 
            based on their classification in-game.</p>
