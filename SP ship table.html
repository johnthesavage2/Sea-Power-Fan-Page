            <p>*The Soviets referred to ships made from a single design by project number and not a class name. For example the Kirovs 
                were the Project 1144 cruisers, Slavas 1164, Sovremenny 956, etc. Here I am using the name that NATO gave to the Soviet 
                classes.</p>
            <p>**The classifications made here are according to how the game classifies them.</p>
            <p>***Displacement values are approximated to the nearest 100. Figures are using full load displacement where that differs from 
                standard displacement.</p>
